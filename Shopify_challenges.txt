Fall 2022 Data Science Intern Challenge

1. 

a. Looking at the data, it seems that there are some outliers on the higher end which are bringing the average up significantly. Shop 78 sells two products for $51450, for example. They sell this 46 times. This must either be a mistake in shop 78's recording system such as this value being computes as an integer instead of a float (forgot to add decimal), or a single user buying a pair of historically important and expensive shoes. 

b. We could instead order the order_amount values in ascending order and find the median value. Since there are clear outliers, (and only 97 of them total), we can find median instead of mean to find a more accurate measure of the AOV.

c. The media is $284.00, which seems like a much more reasonable value for the average value of an order. 

2. 

a. 
SELECT Count(ShipperName)
FROM Shippers ship, Orders ord
WHERE ship.ShipperID = ord.ShipperID
AND ShipperName = 'Speedy Express';

Yields 54 orders shipped by Speedy Express.

b. 
SELECT LastName, COUNT(LastName) as Freq
FROM Employees emp, Orders ord
WHERE emp.EmployeeID = ord.EmployeeID
GROUP BY LastName
ORDER BY Freq DESC;

Yields 'Peacock' as the Last name of the employee with the most orders.

c. 
SELECT ProductName, COUNT(ProductName) as Freq
FROM Products pro, OrderDetails ordd, Orders ords, Customers cus
WHERE pro.ProductID = ordd.ProductID AND ordd.OrderID = ords.OrderID AND ords.CustomerID = cus.CustomerID
AND Country = 'Germany'
GROUP BY ProductName
ORDER BY Freq DESC;

Yields 'Gorgonzola Telino' as the most common product ordered in the country of Germany.
